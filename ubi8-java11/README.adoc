For Dockerfiles of quarkus based apps that inherit from this one, typically include the following in that child Dockerfile:

-----
COPY --chown=1001 target/quarkus-app/lib/ /deployments/lib/
COPY --chown=1001 target/quarkus-app/*.jar /deployments/
COPY --chown=1001 target/quarkus-app/app/ /deployments/app/
COPY --chown=1001 target/quarkus-app/quarkus/ /deployments/quarkus/

There four distinct layers so if there are application changes the library layers can be re-used
